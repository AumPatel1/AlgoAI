# Algo AI - AI Phone Calls Platform

## Overview

Algo AI is a full-stack SaaS application that replicates the functionality of the Bland AI platform. It's designed to provide AI-powered phone call services with a modern, dark-themed user interface. The application consists of a public-facing marketing website and a secure, authenticated dashboard for managing AI phone call campaigns.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React Context for authentication, TanStack Query for server state
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for development and production

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt for password hashing
- **Storage**: Configurable storage layer with in-memory fallback for development

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for production)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Migration System**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations
- **Development Storage**: In-memory storage implementation for testing

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- JWT token-based authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Protected routes with middleware
- User session management with localStorage

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Stores user credentials, profile information, and credit balances
- **Calls Table**: Tracks phone calls with metadata, duration, status, and transcripts
- Relationships: Users have many calls (one-to-many)

### UI Design System
- Dark theme with custom color palette matching Bland AI aesthetic
- Custom CSS variables for consistent theming
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements

### Page Structure
- **Public Pages**: Landing page, login, signup
- **Protected Pages**: Dashboard, analytics, call logs, send call interface
- **Layout System**: Sidebar navigation for dashboard pages

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration/Login**: Form submission → API validation → JWT generation → Client storage
2. **Authenticated Requests**: Client includes JWT → Server validates → Database operations → Response
3. **Call Management**: User creates call → Validation → Database storage → Status tracking
4. **Real-time Updates**: TanStack Query for automatic data synchronization

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL
- **UI Framework**: React with Radix UI components
- **Authentication**: JWT for token management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- **Development**: Vite with HMR support

### Development Tools
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Drizzle Kit for database migrations
- Replit integration for cloud development

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Assets**: Static files served from public directory

### Environment Configuration
- Database URL configuration via environment variables
- JWT secret key for production security
- Development vs production mode handling

### Production Deployment
- Server starts with `node dist/index.js`
- Serves static files and API routes
- Database migrations applied via `drizzle-kit push`
